# BSUIR schedule for telegram
#### What it was made for?
When you are on a **full time** education you are used to wake up, do morning routine, suit up and drive to your university.  
When your classes are **remote**, you obviously let yourself sleep for several more hours, your thoughts are clouded,  
and as a result you can miss your classes (*like i do Kappa*).  
To fix this issue this bot was created.

#### How to use? 
 You can add it to your group chat / use your chat with bot and it will notify you every time your lesson starts.  
`/init {6 digit Group Number}` will initiate notifications in current chat for mentioned group (multiple groups are supported)  
`/toggle {6 digit Group Number}` will disable / enable notifications  
`/list {6 digit Group Number}` will list schedule for today
